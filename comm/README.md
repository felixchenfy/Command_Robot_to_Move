This folder uses files to enable the communication between ROS (python2) and Python3.

In my project, these two parts need Python3: (1) object detection, and (2) speech commands recognition. Thus I created this folder.

See these files for more detailes:
```
src/speech_recognition/voice_listener.py  
src/speech_recognition/voice_speaker.py  
src/detection/yolo_request.py  
src/detection/yolo_response.py  
```
